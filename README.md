## Credits

### This is a React application and was was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this application. I especially used what I learned in Module 20 and the code that was given through Module 20 as a guide for this challenge. I took the code for the contact form and my stylesheet from the Module 20 lessons. I relied on the React docs throughout: [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). I specifically relied on the documentation about components and props, which can be found here: https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html. For colors choices for the styling, I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co). My tutor Rebecca Burke helped me to get Navigational links working. Our class TA Shazeen Fabius helped me with props drilling.
